There are three types of design patterns:

1. Creational - deal with creation of objects
   (Book: Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms which increase flexibility and
          reuse of existing code)
   (Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype(clone), Singleton)

2. Structural - Once you create objects, you need to relate them. These design patterns deal with
                creating relationships between objects
   (Book: Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping
          this structures flexible and efficient)
   (Adapter, Decorator, Proxy)

3. Behavioral - Once the objects are related to each other, they need to communicate with each other. These design
                patterns deal with creating communication between objects
   (Observer, Strategy)
